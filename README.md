# Discord-Delete-Bot
This Bot is a really simple Client Bot (**Windows only!!**), that deletes all your messages in the selected Channel or Private Chat.
It only deletes you messages.

**Instructions**
1. Download the Files and place them in the same Folder.
2. Start the Batch file
3. Klick as fast as possible in the Message Box in the Channel/Chat you want to delete your messages
4. To stop the Bot, klick at the cmd Window and press CTRL + C or simply close the Window

**How this works**
It just simulates Key presses, nothing more, it doesn't stop automatically

**Important Info**
Dont use it (or at your own risk), as it could be against the Discord ToS (No Self-Bots allowed)
It could be allowed, but I don't think so
Because of that I *didn't* test it, but if I *would* test it, it would work perfectly without errors.
